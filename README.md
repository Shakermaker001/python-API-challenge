  - Data pulled is based off of current date and time (10/29/23, 2pm CT)

  VactationPy.ipynb
  -This file plots the coordinates of the random cities on a map and filters through ideal critereia of the data points
  -A for loop is constructed to make an API request based off of the ideal criteria to find the nearest hotel in queried city
  -The hotels are added to the ideal dataframe and plotted on a map

  Note: The temperature criteria was wided due to lack of returned data
